# SEAL 911

SEAL 911 is a project designed to give users, developers, and security researchers an **accessible way** to connect with a small group of highly trusted security professionals in case of emergency. The group can be reached via the [SEAL 911 Telegram bot](https://t.me/seal_911_bot).

> [!TIP]
> You can read about the other ongoing initiatives of the Security Alliance [here](https://securityalliance.org). Furthermore, SEAL 911's official Xwitter account is [@seal_911](https://x.com/seal_911).

## How Do I Join?

Given the high trust required for this project to function, membership is available on an **invite-only** basis. Typically, at least one existing member will vouch for the new member. Commercial organisations are limited to a maximum of two members.

## Beyond Our Volunteer Capacity

SEAL 911 operates as a volunteer-based organisation and does **not** provide paid services. We handle tickets based on available bandwidth from our volunteer members. Many tickets require extensive onchain tracing work over long periods of time that we cannot provide due to the high volume of tickets we handle. However, several SEAL 911 members specialise in tracing work and offer professional services through their own firms. You can find them listed here (please note that the order does not indicate any preference):

- [Tracelon](https://tracelon.com)
- [Cryptoforensic Investigators](https://cryptoforensic.com)
- [zeroShadow](https://www.zeroshadow.io)

Additionally, there are other professional firms outside of SEAL 911 that provide similar specialised services in this field.

## Members

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Should a SEAL 911 member reach out to you directly, please take the following steps to ensure their authenticity. Share an unguessable keyword sentence with them. Then, open a ticket in the [SEAL 911 Telegram bot](https://t.me/seal_911_bot) and request the SEAL 911 member to provide the shared keyword. Provided the [SEAL 911 Telegram bot](https://t.me/seal_911_bot) remains uncompromised, this process will effectively verify the authenticity of any SEAL 911 member who contacts you.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you suspect that SEAL 911 has been compromised in any way, please don't hesitate to reach out [here](https://securityalliance.org/.well-known/security.txt) and include any supporting evidence you may have. Please note that any claims made without any evidence will be disregarded.
