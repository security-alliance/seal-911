# SEAL 911

SEAL 911 is a project designed to give users, developers, and even other security researchers an accessible method to contact a small group of highly trusted security researchers. The group can be reached via the [Telegram bot](https://t.me/seal_911_bot).

## How do I join?

Given the high trust required for this project to function, membership is available on an invite-only basis. Typically, at least one existing member will vouch for the new member. Commercial organizations are limited to a maximum of two members.
