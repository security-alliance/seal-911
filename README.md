# SEAL 911

SEAL 911 is a project designed to give users, developers, and security researchers an **accessible way** to connect with a small group of highly trusted security professionals in case of emergency. The group can be reached via the [SEAL 911 Telegram bot](https://t.me/seal_911_bot).

> [!TIP]
> You can read about the other ongoing initiatives of the Security Alliance [here](https://securityalliance.org).

## How Do I Join?

Given the high trust required for this project to function, membership is available on an **invite-only** basis. Typically, at least one existing member will vouch for the new member. Commercial organisations are limited to a maximum of two members.

## Members

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Should a SEAL 911 member reach out to you directly, please take the following steps to ensure their authenticity. Share an unguessable keyword sentence with them. Then, open a ticket in the [SEAL 911 Telegram bot](https://t.me/seal_911_bot) and request the SEAL 911 member to provide the shared keyword. Provided the [SEAL 911 Telegram bot](https://t.me/seal_911_bot) remains uncompromised, this process will effectively verify the authenticity of any SEAL 911 member who contacts you.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you suspect that SEAL 911 has been compromised in any way, please don't hesitate to reach out [here](https://securityalliance.org/.well-known/security.txt) and include any supporting evidence you may have. Please note that any claims made without any evidence will be disregarded.
