# SEAL 911

SEAL 911 is a project designed to give users, developers, and security researchers an **accessible way** to connect with a small group of highly trusted security professionals in case of emergency. The group can be reached via the [SEAL 911 Telegram bot](https://t.me/seal_911_bot).

> [!TIP]
> You can read about the other ongoing initiatives of the Security Alliance [here](https://securityalliance.org).
